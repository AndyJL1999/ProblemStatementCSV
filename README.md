<h1>Task</h1>

Use Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition is free!) or newer version to craft a C# Windows Forms App (.NET Framework 4.6.1 or newer version) with a button and a text field.  The button brings up a file selector that allows the user to select a CSV file.  Once the CSV file is selected, the following process is to be performed on it and the results are to be displayed in the text box 

Each row in the CSV file represents a different, large number.  Find the final ten digits of the sum of all rows of the CSV file (that is, the ones place, the tens, etc.).  This process should be robust in that it should work with no regard to the size of the numbers (it should work with small numbers as well!)
